I'm installing pandas for cleaning, loading, and storing of options chain data. I used it to read and write to CSV files, filter rows, and handle missing data, group by expiration, etc.

I'm installing yfinance to fetch stock and options data from Yahoo Finance via a simple API. I used it to get options chains for a symbol(ex: AAPL, TSLA), access current stock prices, and avoid complex scraping/paid APIs.

I'm installing matplotlib for basic visualization and used it to create scatter plots and show trends in things like expired dates and flagged anomalies.
